1.	History:
NFC (Near Field Communication) came out of RFID. RFID, or radio-frequency identification, is the technology used by shipping companies, in large warehouses, and in superstores to keep track of goods. It uses electromagnetic induction in order to transmit information over a short space so that by simply scanning a container a staff member can know what it contains. NFC is similar technology, but standardized for consumer smartphones. NFC standards are defined by a group called the NFC Forum, which includes Nokia, Sony and Philips.

2.	About:

Near field communication, abbreviated NFC, is a form of contactless communication between devices like smartphones or tablets. Contactless communication allows a user to wave the smartphone over a NFC compatible device to send information without needing to touch the devices together or go through multiple steps setting up a connection.

The technology behind NFC allows a device, known as a reader, interrogator, or active device, to create a radio frequency current that communicates with another NFC compatible device or a small NFC tag holding the information the reader wants. Passive devices, such as the NFC tag in smart posters, store information and communicate with the reader but do not actively read other devices. Peer-to-peer communication through two active devices is also a possibility with NFC. This allows both devices to send and receive information.

3.	How Works:

NFC is based on RFDI technology communication between electronic devices in close proximity, typically up to 10cm and operates at 13.56MHz and transfer data at up to 424 bits/s.
When communicating up close, usually within one wavelength’s distance from the antennae sending out the signal, this is known as near field communication. This type of communication is ideal for sending information between two devices, even if one device has no power source of its own. The first device, a smartphone for example, creates an electromagnetic field around it and the receiving device, such as a NFC tag embedded in a smart poster, is charged by that field. The NFC tag needs no other power source and thus can remain quite small in size.
Once the signal from the smartphone reaches and starts powering the NFC tag, the smartphone begins sending out signals to determine what kind of information the tag contains. When the smartphone learns what information the tag holds, it requests this information and a connection is established. 
The smartphone and NFC tag communicate by altering the fields they are generating. Changing the signals sent out from low to high or high to low registers as 1s and 0s, or binary code. The devices interpret the binary code as instructions and reply in kind.
After the transaction is complete or the smartphone is moved away from the NFC tag, the connection is broken and the NFC tag loses its power until the next person comes along and waves her smartphone over it.

There are three different NFC modes, as defined by the NFC Forum:
Reader/writer: An NFC device reads and writes data from and to an NFC tag.
Peer-to-peer mode: Two NFC devices establish a Logical Link Control Protocol (LLCP) Link, over which they can provide many NFC services: SNEP for exchanging NFC-formatted data, NFC Handover for initiating a carrier (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) OBEX over NFC or any proprietary protocol.
Card emulation: An NFC device pretends to be an NFC tag. Payment and transaction issuers use this mode to enable contactless payments over NFC. In card emulation mode, payment applets typically take control of the NFC radio and expose themselves as an NFC tag that can be read from an NFC-capable point-of-sale terminal. This is a contactless payment.

4.	Applicability:
Both businesses and individuals benefit from near field communication technology. By integrating credit cards, subway tickets, and paper coupons all into one device, a customer can board a train, pay for groceries, redeem coupons or store loyalty points, and even exchange contact information all with the wave of a smartphone. Faster transaction times mean less waiting in line and happier customers. Fewer physical cards to carry around means the customer is less likely to lose one or have it stolen. Those are just a few possibilities for the use of NFC.

5.	Some Benefits of NFC:

General: Versatile, Open and Standards-Based, Technology-Enabling, Inherently Secure, Interoperable, Security-Ready.

For Individuals: Contactless Payments, Information Sharing, Transportation, Health Care, Social Networking.

For Business: Staff Communication, Real Time Updates, Improved Customer Service.

6.	TAG&TAP Description:
•	This app interacts with your surroundings storing a URL address into a Tag. 
•	Once a user types the URL address in the respective field (“Insert URL”) and press the button (“Write Tag”) just needs to tap the tag near the NFC device (built in the smartphone) to complete the recording action (writing). 
•	Now the information is stored in the tag and can be access just tapping the tag against the NFC device (reading). 
•	In that stage the website will pops up on the smartphone screen. The process can be done several times and the NFC device will read the last information that was stored.

All logos, pictures, animations and styling were create by myself by using software such as: Photoshop CS6, Notepad++ and Audacity.
The sounds and music used in the project were edited using software resources. The original sound and music are free source whose were downloaded from the following addresses:
